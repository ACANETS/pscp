# pscp
PerfSONAR Control Plane

Our control plane is used to start a test between two perfSONAR hosts, monitor the throughput performance and locate the source of network issues when problem happens

control_plane.py is the main function of pscp.

To start the control plane, use "python control_plane.py [source_host_name] [destination_host_name]".
